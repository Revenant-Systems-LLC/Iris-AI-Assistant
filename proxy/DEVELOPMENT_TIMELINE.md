Gemini-Web-Viewer.user.js created out of the need to have LLMs see what I see. 

All of the proxy local node server completed.

Spent MOST of the day working on UI/UX


Gemini-Web-Viewer_v2.user.js created

patch included ChatGPT as a choice of LLM, and added several Gemini versions. I also added both Grok and Claude, but do not have the funds to buy tokens to test it out. So they will remain in the code, but dormant for now.

Still a Userscript + local proxy set up.


Iris-AI-Assistant Chrome Extension created

ran into several developer bugs and issues

had so many I decided to re-make the repository

Repository 'github.com/Revenant-Systems-LLC/iris-ai-assistant' created

earnest testing begins
